# Project Ecommerce Frontend

This is a basic frontend project that uses React in order to consume a ecommerce backend.

Some of Requisits are:

- The system should allow the user to load the pricing file.
- The system must have a button called VALIDATE.
- The system must also have a UPDATE button. Which will only be enabled if all
archive products are validated and no rules are broken.
- When clicking UPDATE, the system must save the new price in the database and leave
the screen ready for sending a new file.
